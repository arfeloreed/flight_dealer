A personal project that looks for cheap flight tickets available from my home city
requirements:

pip install twilio

google sheet access

A personal project for my own used. It finds cheap flight tickets from my home city on any airline carrier. Currently it is set between Manila and Cebu city and is based on my country's currency. You need an account on https://sheety.co/ that has access to your google sheet. Then make an account on https://partners.kiwi.com/ in order to make api requests about the different ticket prices from many available airlines. Lastly, you also need to make an account on https://www.twilio.com to send an SMS notification to my mobile number in case a certain ticket price is within my parameters.
